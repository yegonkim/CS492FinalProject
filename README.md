# Automatic Emotion Diary (CS492I) 📖
------------------------------------
- We aim to replace `second-level authentication` with `voice-verficiation` along which an user is asked to write an `emotional diary`.
- With `voice-verification`, we also detect `multi-modal emotion detection` from `speech` and `text` (extracted with `speech recognition module`, `vosk`), possibly providing different UIs/suggestions in the future along with the detected emotion.
- With this end, we also aim to help user to record their status everyday, and `provide mental clinical provision`, if negative emotions are consistently observed.
