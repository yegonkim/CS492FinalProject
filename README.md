# How's Your Day? (CS492I) üìñ
------------------------------------
- We aim to replace `second-level authentication` with `voice-verficiation` along which an user is asked to write an `emotional diary`.
- With `voice-verification`, we also detect `multi-modal emotion detection` from `speech` and `text` (extracted with `speech recognition module`, `vosk`), possibly providing different UIs/suggestions in the future along with the detected emotion.
- With this end, we also aim to help user to record their status everyday, and `provide mental clinical provision`, if negative emotions are consistently observed. 

Below are the brief description of each directory, and please refer to `README.md` of each directory for more information.

#### Speech Recognition üëÇ
---
For `Speech Recognition`, we used a pretrained Vosk model to convert speech to text.

#### Speaker Verifcation üîí
---
For `Speaker Verification`, we used a d-vector approach with GE2E Loss to verify the identity of the speaker.

#### TER (Text Emotion Recognition) ‚úçÔ∏è
---
For `TER`, we aimed to use bert based TEXT-only module to classify the emotion.

#### SER (Speech Emotion Recognition) üó£Ô∏è
---
For `SER`, we aimed to use wac2vec2 based SPEECH-only module to classify the emotion.

#### MM (Multimodal Emotional Recognition) üì†
----
For `MM`, we implemented the multimodal (audio + text) emotion classifier, adopting each module from `TER` and `SER`.\
This multimodal approach generalizes best with our testing datasets.
